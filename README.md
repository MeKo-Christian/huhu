## Play the Demo Games

Three versions of the same game — **HU-Drop** — each vibe-coded by a different AI model from the same prompt, with no code review:

| Version | Model            | Play                                           |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Claude  | Anthropic Claude | [Play](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/claude/) |
| Gemini  | Google Gemini    | [Play](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/gemini/) |
| Codex   | OpenAI Codex     | [Play](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/codex/)  |

Or use the **[interactive selector](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/)** to choose.

## Live Demo (Created During the Presentation)

Two additional variants of HU-Drop were generated **live on stage** during the presentation:

| Version       | Play                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude (live) | [Play](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/live-claude/) |
| Codex (live)  | [Play](https://cwbudde.github.io/huhu/live-codex/)  |

## Overview

This presentation explores the emerging discipline of _agentic engineering_ — using AI agents in software development workflows — and contrasts it with _vibe coding_: the practice of generating code via prompts without review or understanding.

The three HU-Drop game implementations serve as a live demonstration: the same prompt, three different models, three different results. None of the code was reviewed before publishing.

## Slides

The slides are written in [Typst](https://typst.app/) and live in [slides/presentation.typ](slides/presentation.typ).

Key topics:

- What is vibe coding, and why is it appealing?
- What is agentic engineering?
- Failure modes and risks of agentic systems
- Skills, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and the AI tooling ecosystem
- The pelican benchmark as a proxy for agentic capability
